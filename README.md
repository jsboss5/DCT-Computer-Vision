This is my branch of Duke Conservation Tech's Drone project. For this project, we are partnered with an australian research team to use drones to facilitate the research and tracking of Green Sea turtles off the coast of Australia. We utilize a QR-like tag painted on the turtles' shells to track them. 

In order to test out our script, run "Arjun:Josh Sliding window.py." The script utilizes a sliding window to account for images taken at very large distances in which a tag is unrecognizable, and for extremely high resolution photos. The script also outputs a photo of the tag. 

We will begin working in the fall on writing data to a back end database and building a web application and UI to interact with the turtle data.
